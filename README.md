# 🐍 Python QA Practice: Functions & Classes

This project contains practical Python exercises focused on developing QA Automation skills. The code is structured into modules to demonstrate functions, classes, and their interaction.

## 📂 Project Structure

### 🔹 [Part 1: Functions](part1_functions.py)
Basic concepts of procedural programming:
*   Creating simple functions (greeting, sum, string length).
*   Functions with return values and conditional logic.
*   **QA Use Cases:** Equality checks, status code validation, email generation.

### 🔹 [Part 2: Classes](part2_classes.py)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in the context of testing:
*   Basics of classes and attributes (`User`, `Product`).
*   Class methods and state management (`Counter`).
*   **Classes for QA:** Mocking `TestCase`, `APIResponse`, and `DataGenerator`.

### 🔹 [Part 3: Combined Tasks](part3_combined.py)
Integration of functions and classes:
*   Creating objects via factory functions.
*   Object state validation.
*   Using helper classes (e.g., `Logger`) within test scenarios.

## 🚀 How to Run

To execute all tests and demonstrate the code logic, run the `run_practice.py` script:

```bash
python run_practice.py
```

## 🛠 Technologies
*   Python 3.13
*   OOP Patterns
*   Test Scenario Modeling
